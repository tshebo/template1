# React Routing and Authentication Template

This project is a basic React template designed for handling routing and authentication. It provides simple, customizable authentication pages connected to Firebase. React Router DOM is used to manage route paths and their accessibility levels, allowing for easy navigation between different sections of the application. The project also utilizes AuthContext to monitor login activity using the useContext hook, and React Hook Form to manage form inputs for authentication. Tailwind CSS is included for styling purposes.
